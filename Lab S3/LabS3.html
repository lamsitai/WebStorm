        <h2>PROFILE</h2>
        <p>Phipps was born in Berkeley parish in Gloucestershire to a poor, landless labourer working as
            Jenner's gardener. He was baptised in St Mary's parish church, Berkeley, when he was 4. On 14
            May 1796 he was selected by Jenner, who took "a healthy boy, about eight years old for the
            purpose of inoculation for the Cow Pox". Jenner took some fluid from the cowpox vesicles on
            the hand of a milkmaid named Sarah Nelmes (in an unpublished manuscript Jenner refers to her
            as Lucy Nelmes), and inoculated Phipps by two small cut in the skin of the boy's arm.

        <p>Phipps is often cited incorrectly as the first person to be vaccinated against smallpox by
            inoculation with cowpox: other people had undergone the procedure before him. In 1791, Peter
            Plett from Kiel in the Duchy of Holstein (now Germany) inoculated three children,[10] and
            Benjamin Jesty of Yetminster in Dorset performed the procedure on three family members in 1774.
            However, Jenner included his description of the vaccination of Phipps and an illustration of
            the hand of Sarah Nelmes from which the material was taken in his Inquiry published in 1798.
            Together with a series of vaccinations which showed that the vaccine could be maintained by
            arm to arm transfer, and information about selection of suitable material, Jenner's Inquiry
            was the first published account of vaccination</p>
