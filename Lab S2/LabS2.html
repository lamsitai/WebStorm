        <p>I worked in administrative and comercial sector of companies in deiffrent segments:</p>
        <p>In Public Health, as the byer of Fiotec, given national demnad of FIOCRUZ.</p>
        <p>It’s very important to choose a flashy and well-organized format.</p>
        <p>The design of this presentation is based on geometric patterns and triangular shapes.</p>
        <p>Giving dynamism and a sense of rhythm and movement to everything you want to say.</p>
        <p>The typography chosen for the titles is a sans-serif font, which makes them much easier to
            read.</p>
        <p>As for the texts, there’s a serif font, great for achieving maximum readability, especially with
            smaller sizes.</p>

            in no time.</p>
